			<p>
		    To Humans, A Noble Acme Life (THANAL) is a social action club dedicated to humanitarian welfare and is responsible for raising funds and other amenities to help the weaker sections of the society.
			<br>
			We Stand For:
			<ol >
				<li type="i">Creating awareness among students about the living conditions of our less fortunate fellow beings and to explore avenues where we can be of help to them.
				<li type="i">Cultivating the awareness that the dignity of the human beings is paramount, and is the source for all human rights.
				<li type="i">Spreading the message that charity is not a service, but a mandatory duty for every individual.
			</ol>
			<br>
					
			<p>
			Some of our humble endeavours are:</P>
			<br>
			<ol >
				<li> One-Day One Rupee
				<p>This is an initiative through which each student contributes Rs.1 everyday. The sum collected through this program adds up to an average of Rs.30000 per month. This amount is used to buy medicines for cancer patients at the Government General Hospital, Ernakulam. This simple venture has proved to be very effective in channeling the students\' self-contributed fund as a ray of hope to the distressed.
				</p><br></li>
				<li> Computer Collection</li>
				<p>Student volunteers of THANAL assemble computer systems from working parts of old computers brought in by the students of the college. Through this initiative, THANAL aims to impart basic technical knowledge and skills to the inmates of orphanages for their betterment. Through thi initiative a whole new arena of knowledge is set open to these children who are deprived of many joys in life.
				</p><br></li>
				<li>A Lending Hand</li>
				<p>Every quarter, clothes, toys and books are deposited in drop boxes placed at various locations in and around the college campus by the students. The neatly packed and sorted items are distributed to the various orphanages and old age homes. So far, Providence Home Village, Bethlehem Abhaya Bhavan Koovapady, Relief Settlement and Sneha Bhavan, Palluruthy have benefited from this THANAL initiative. 
				</p><br></li>
				<li>Thaalam
				<p>THANAL volunteers organize regular visits to various old age homes and orphanages, which are aimed at spending quality time with the inmates and organizing cultural activities. Trips to Providence Home Village, Bethlehem Abhaya Bhavan Koovapady, Sneha Bhavan Palluruthy and Relief Settlement Palluruthy, have already been organized, leaving both the inmates and the volunteers with immensely rewarding and touching experiences to cherish. The initiative helps the volunteers to crib less about each tear and instead spread more smiles.
				</p><br></li>
				<li> Akshayapatra 
				<p>Each student brings an extra packet of food on Wednesday mornings. These are collected and distributed to people in need from nearby charitable organizations. This would help to create a spirit of sharing in each of these students\' hearts as well as their homes.
				</p><br></li>
				<li> B’day Bash 
				<p>Through a unique programme promoted by THANAL, students are encouraged to celebrate their birthdays at different orphanages. By cutting cakes with the inmates, and donating toys, sweets, and food on such blessed occasions, students get a rare chance to truly spread the joy. This way, the students get to spend their most precious moments in the most blessed way.
				</p><br></li>
				<li> Home Sweet Home
				<p>THANAL was able to do our little mite in helping about 18 inmates of the Palluruthy relief settlement to return back to their homes in Bihar. We had contributed a healthy sum, raised completely through donations from students for this noble cause, thus managing to cover the entire expense for their journey.
				</p><br></li>
				<li>Food From Hostels 
				<p>THANAL also has tied up with the men’s hostel of our college to provide the dinner to the inmates of a few orphanages every Saturday. Knowing that a 100 hungry stomachs are being fed through them will add a cheer to the inmates of the hostel as they enjoy their special Saturday night dinner.
				</p><br></li>
				<li> Tour of a Lifetime 
				<p>The members  arranged a tour for the inmates of orphanages to nearby culturally and historically important localities, giving them an enjoyable and deeply rewarding learning experience.
